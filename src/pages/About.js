  . My work bridges the gap between software engineering and deep network testing — from automating traffic with Spirent/Ixia to optimizing WiFi radios with C, Python, and Docker in high-performance, low-latency environments.

  Before this, I was a Software Engineer at{" "}

  for 3 years, where I built global-scale data pipelines, designed RESTful APIs, and scaled microservices using AWS, Kubernetes, and Spring. I also led efforts in performance tuning and risk analytics dashboards, making data faster and smarter.

  My academic foundation was laid at{" "}

    BITS Pilani

  , where I studied Electronics & Instrumentation, which sparked my love for systems thinking and problem-solving.
</p>

<p>
  I thrive at the intersection of software, networks, and systems — especially when it comes to performance optimization, infrastructure testing, and clean, scalable code. My core strengths? Deep debugging skills, speed of execution, and strong ownership from ideation to delivery.
</p>

<p>
  Outside work, you’ll find me running long distances, diving into football matches, reading thought-provoking books, or adventuring outdoors. I love simplifying complex ideas and building things that matter.
